## A demo implementation of ML in a classification problem
 
A simple implementation of ML for breast cancer prediction with Python. The main program also has a demo with a simple web app. Accuracy of classification is not a concern here.

This is an updated clone that runs with Python 3.10.

The dataset is pulled from [(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Faizal215/FYP-Test1/main/data.csv)]


## Interface with Azure as a web app

The code can be used to run on Azure
